              <h1>Controlling Mosquitoes</h1>

              <p>  As with most insect pests, the best way to control mosquitoes is to get rid of their breeding sites. This means making sure
                that water is not allowed to collect in unwanted equipment and containers which are left lying around.</p>
              <img class="push-left" src="images/mosquito.jpg">
                <p>These containers might include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Car bodies and panels, engine blocks and tyres.</li>
                    <li>Tin cans, plastic containers, drums, lids and jars.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>Mosquitoes can also breed in:
                    <ul>
                      <li>water which has collected in blocked gutters and drains</li>
                      <li>water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains which do not have lids</li>
                      <li>still areas of water in sewage lagoons</li>
                      <li>pools of water lying under leaking taps</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to make sure that there are always lids on water tanks, septic tanks and leach drains and that sewage ponds
                       are kept free of grass and other vegetation around the edges.

For those mosquitoes which do manage to breed somewhere and become a pest in the community, it is important to keep them out of houses.

Putting up flywire on all door openings and windows is a good way of keeping mosquitoes out. Wearing cover-up clothes and using insect repellent on
exposed skin reduces the risk of being bitten when outside
during the biting times. Loose clothes are best because mosquitoes can bite through clothing which is tight against the skin, even jeans. Sleeping
children and babies should be protected with mosquito nets. Insect repellent should never be used on babies – cover them with a net instead.</P>

          <h1>Controlling Bedbugs</h1>
          <img src="images/Bedbugs.jpg">
          <p>Bed bugs are one of the most difficult pest problems to eradicate quickly. By far, the best solution for bed
            bugs is to hire a pest control company with experience successfully controlling bed bugs. Unfortunately, this
            can be expensive and beyond the means of many people. If you feel you cannot afford to hire a professional,
            and want to attempt do-it-yourself bed bug control, there are some things you can do. With diligence and
            patience and some hard work you have a fighting chance of getting rid of bed bugs in your home. Here are some
            helpful ways to control:
            <ul>
              <li>Diatomaceous Earth is a powder that’s effective for a number of different pests, including bed bugs, and
                it’s chemical free, made from the fossil remains of tiny aquatic organisms. It kills bed bugs by dehydrating
                 them as it contains properties that absorb the fat and oils from the insects. Apply 100% Pure Diatomaceous
                 Earth powder around the infested area, and eventually, you’ll see dead bed bugs that can be vacuumed away.
                 While it takes as long as 10 days for it to kill them, it has a very high mortality rate at greater than 90%,
                  and it’s also easy to sprinkle in cracks and crevices that can otherwise be hard to get to.<br>
                  Before you use it, be sure to wash all of your linens in the hottest water possible, and vacuum your home
                   thoroughly. When you’re ready to sprinkle it onto affected areas like your bed and bedroom, put on a mask.
                    While food grade diatomaceous earth is safe to eat, if you inhale it, it can cause damage to your lungs as
                    the tiny pieces are actually very sharp and jagged, although they may feel smooth to your hands. After a few
                     days, vacuum the powder up and repeat the entire process to ensure you get recently hatched bed bugs. Continue
                     to follow the process every few days for about two weeks.</li>
                     <li>In addition to washing all linens, mattress covers, fabrics, etc. in the hottest water possible,
                       vacuuming everything you possibly can helps eliminate a bed bug infestation. Be sure to vacuum all
                       chairs and other soft furnishings, all carpets, box springs, and mattresses as well as mattress encasements,
                       and even curtains. Bed bugs can basically be hiding anywhere and everywhere, including upholstered furniture
                       and especially in obscure places. It’s actually not all that uncommon to discover them in electric appliances too.
                        Vacuum all rooms thoroughly, at least once a week, leaving no stone left unturned. Dispose of the vacuum bag,
                         outside, after you finish vacuuming the area.</li>
                         <li>Baking soda works by basically drying out the bed bugs, as it sucks the moisture from them and ultimately
                           kills them. Spread a light layer of it throughout all affected rooms in the home, layering it from every wall
                            to the doorways and corners –  wherever you think bed bugs may have infested. Allow the baking soda to sit
                            for an entire week. After a week has passed, suck up all the baking soda with a vacuum cleaner, basically
                            following the above vacuuming process, getting each and every area very thoroughly to ensure that there are
                             no eggs or bed bugs anywhere.</li>
                             <li>While most of us associate the floral aroma of lavender with soaps, relaxation, and calm, surprisingly,
                                it can also be used as an effective way to battle bed bugs. In fact, lavender essential oil has been used as
                                 a bug repellent for centuries, often utilized to protect clothes and linens from the infestation of moths and
                                  other insects.<br>
Similar to tea tree oil, lavender essential oil can make an excellent, effective natural spray for killing bed bugs as it contains insect-repelling
 properties that are toxic to them, but entirely safe for us and our pets. One study that looked at the effects of essential oils and their use for
 insect and bug control discovered that a combination of lavender oil and peppermint oil managed to effectively kill insects. Lavender oil, in particular,
  is known to destroy the eggs and larvae of bed bugs, as well as repelling the bed bugs themselves. Peppermint oil also offers powerful repellent action.
   In fact, one study, published in the Malaria Journal demonstrated why it works – the researchers proved that it provides strong repellent action when applied
    to exposed body parts. It also showed significant larvicidal and mosquito repellent action, with mosquito larvae killed 24 hours after exposure to a solution
    of peppermint oil and water.<br>
    To make this natural pesticide spray, simply fill a spray bottle with water, and add about 15 drops of lavender essential oil and 15 drops of peppermint oil –
    both available to buy from here. Shake well and then spray in all infested areas of your home. Continue to do this daily until all signs of the bed bugs are gone.</li>

          <h1>Controlling Mice</h1>
          <img src="images/rat.jpg">
          <p>Seeing even one mouse or in your house can mean that there is a whole family (with babies, aunts, uncles, and other kinfolk) of rodents living in your home's
             basement, the walls, or in and between stored items. This is because mice (and rats) are most active at night when you are less likely to see them.
             Here is some helpful information on how to control:
             <ul>
               <li>Make sure that all food that is not in a can or jar is stored in the refrigerator or heavy plastic container during service, and for at least two weeks afterward.
                  This includes chips, candies, nuts, cereals, bread, any grain-based food, pet foods, etc., that are normally stored in upper or lower cabinets, on counter tops, or
                   on top of the refrigerator. Although usually bagged, rodents can chew right through plastic bags to get to foods.</li>
                   <li>Repair any holes in walls, around baseboards, or doors that don’t seal properly. This is because mice can enter through gaps as small as 1/4 inch and rats
                     through holes as small as 1/2 inch in diameter.</li>
                     <li>For ongoing control, clean, sweep and vacuum the home regularly. Take out the trash on a regular basis, keep lids on trash cans, and keep all areas as
                       clean as possible.</li>
                       <li>Eliminate any unnecessary storage including boxes, paper, and clothing, because rodents (and other pests) will take shelter here, gnaw the items to
                          make their nests, and even breed in undisturbed areas.</li>

                  <img src="images/Termites.jpg">
                  <p>Termites is small social insects, same as bees or ants, but the damage they can cause is certainly not. And the worst thing about them is that they act silently.

This means that termites might be already start making damages to your home while you even don’t know. When you notice the first signs of damage, it might already too late and your
 property might have been already affected.

The reason why termites are attracted to come into your houses is because they find there their favorite food: Cellulose based trees and plants. So their favorite food is the dead wood,
 which they can plenty find in our houses, in books, furniture, shelves and in the house’s foundation.
 <ol>
   <li><strong>Low Temperature:</strong>Low temperature will terminate termites from your house. Low temperature would mean-20 degree Fahrenheit. You would need liquid nitrogen to bring
      the down the temperature.</li>
      <li><strong>Flooding Kills Termites:<strong>Simply drown the termites to get rid of them. If you have a garden and you see small mud-tubes created then dig through it and flood that
        area. In this way you can naturally get rid of them.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong>If there is not enough sunlight penetrating your home then it is likely that termites will destroy your house. Sunlight plays an important role in
          killing the termites naturally. Do not keep the windows close during the daytime. Let enough sunlight come in.</li>
          <li><strong>Salt Kills Termites:</strong>Salt can be an effective and natural method to kill termites.
You just have to fill a jar with equal part of salt and warm water. Yes, it should be very salty. Take a syringe and fill in with salty water. Inject it into all the affected areas.
Termites will die out of dehydration.</li>

            <p>Ants are resilient pests. They’re active year-round, often seen in overwhelming numbers, and resistant to a lot of pest control methods. While getting rid of ants may
               seem like an impossible feat, we’re here to tell you that it is possible.
               <ol>
                 <li>Eliminate Sources of Moisture</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Just like us, ants need water to survive. This time of year especially, they’re in search of a steady water source. Repair leaky plumbing, use dehumidifiers
                     in damp basements, attics and/or crawlspaces to keep the spaces dry, keep gutters clean, and remove any sources of moisture around your home’s perimeter.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <li> Keep a Clean House</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>ust like water, ants are looking for food. Even the smallest amount can satisfy ants and keep them coming back for more so be sure to clean up spills immediately,
                       wipe away crumbs, clean behind appliances, and take out the trash daily. Keep food sealed in storage containers and consider storing fruit in the refrigerator.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Keep food in containers which have tightly fitting lids.</li>
                <li>Store food handling equipment and containers up off the floor</li>
                <li>Where possible, fill in small cracks and crevices (holes), in which cockroaches could hide. It is especially important to fill in
                  cracks and crevices around pipes in walls</li>
                <li>Clean shelves and inside and underneath cupboards regularly. This will reduce the build-up of food particles.</li>
                <li>Then if required, apply a low toxicity liquid or gel insecticide to those areas where cockroaches may hide, especially cracks and crevices
                  inside and around the outside of buildings, behind stoves and fridges and underneath the shelves of cupboards. There are many suitable
                  insecticides that can be used to effectively control cockroaches. Before insecticides are used, people should be encouraged to regularly
                  clean in and around their houses to reduce the cockroaches’ food source. </li>
